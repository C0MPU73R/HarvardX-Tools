"""
A set of programs for dealing with and manipulating the log files recevied from edX.

Most of these programs are used to convert the log files, received from edX as logs from
each server organized by day, into a form that is more conducive to the research work 
being done; the organization is to have the log entries for each class in a separate
file. Some of these files will cover a week, others can cover the history of an entire
course.

There are also some simple programs to extract basic data from the logs, such as the list of
users and ip addresses for those users, or the number of entries for each user in some set
of logs.
