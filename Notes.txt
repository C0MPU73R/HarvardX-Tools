Notes
certificates file:
	The current edX documentation of the certificates_generatedcertificates
	file is incorrect. The first id in the file is the user's edX id, and
	can be used to cross-reference the user with other files; the second is a 
	sequence number generated for and only meaningful in this file. The documentation
	reverses these and should be corrected.
	
auth_user file:
	Nearly all of the fields in this file are obsolete. Is there any reason to continue
	to include these in the file? It complicates the parsing, makes the files larger, and
	doesn't add any real information. This is also true of the auth_userprofile file,
	where about a third of the fields are no longer gathered or used
